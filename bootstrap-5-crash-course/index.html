  Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Those great big fluffy
            clouds. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just
            have to push them out. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's
            your world. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. I
            want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Put light
            against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have
            nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the
            other one meaning. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes
            you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. A happy cloud. You can't make a
            mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make
            something beautiful out of it. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.
            Let's have a nice tree right here. There we go. You can create
            anything that makes you happy. Just let go - and fall like a little
            waterfall. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have
            no fear. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a
            few. You'll see. The more we do this - the more it will do good
            things to our heart. It just happens - whether or not you worried
            about it or tried to plan it. If you overwork it you become a cloud
            killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Be brave. Give
            him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Now we'll take the
            almighty fan brush. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. See
            how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You have
            to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Nature is so
            fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. It's a very cold
            picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to
            death. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Trees live in
            your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. This present moment
            is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. I thought
            today we would do a happy little picture. Talent is a pursued
            interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Of
            course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other
            kind. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.
            There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.
